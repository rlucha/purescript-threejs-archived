## TODO
- Make Project a graph and provide a way to traverse it (Functor Project?)
- Generalize the project file utils into a project object in Pure3
- Connect datGUI to those params to get some interactivity
- Next steps: Try to reproduce hierarchy2 example from threejs 
- Create a set of JS utils to make IFF less painful
  - Get webpack to serve all files using purs-loader or similar
    - Will this do dead code elimination?
- Orbitcontrol rotate, autoupdate fns, enable zoom, etc.
- Write a bit of documentation about the type decisions on Timeline and Main mostly
- Pass any input value as well as frame to behaviours...
- Move camera into project?
- Add proper fog to scene instead of directly from js
- Transparent canvas color?
- Check for a way to easy the pain on wrapping unwrapping object3D
- get 2d coordinates from any element in canvas to match css elements on top
- Move projects config to a record
- move onResize event to purescript
- throttle onResize
- Replace Maintype with Effect, currently Timeline is coupled
- [NEWTYPE] Wrap / Unwrap using newtype instance for Line and other Pure3 types
